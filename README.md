# Dodge-the-Asteroid
Remake of the game "Asteroids," but instead of shooting the asteroids, you dodge them.

Made using Python3 with the library "Pygame." In order to play you must install Pygame, which can be done in the command prompt by typing "pip install pygame." With Pygame, open the folder and type "cmd" in the path bar at the top of file explorer. In cmd type "py asteroids.py" to start the game.
